# CONTRIBUTING

## Basic development flow

1. Ensure the problem you are solving [is an issue](https://github.com/tophat/yvm/issues) or you've created one
1. Clone the repo
1. We use make, `make help` will show you a list of development commands
1. `make install-watch` will install yvm on your shell, and update when you make changes
1. `make test` and `make lint` are also commonly helpful


## Manual testing command contributions

```bash
make install
yvm <your-command-here>
```
